# Ripple Social Media API

  ## Description  

  

  An exercise in MongoDB, Express, Node, and the Mongoose npm package to create the back end for a social media type web service. This includes friendships, posts (thoughts), and comments (reactions).  

  * Motivation  

    I wanted to combine the knowledge I have using various modern API routing and database management tools to see if I could better understand the things happening behind the scenes for hugely popular social media services such as twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and more.  

  * Reason for Building  

    I build this project to gain positive affirmation that my understanding of noSQL databases is capable of functioning predictibly. In other words, did I understand enough Javascript, logic execution, and Mongoose interfacing to simulation connections between multiple collections on MongoDB without errors?  

  * Problems Solved  

    With only a front end and a few security measures for users to save encrypted passwords, this back in is ready to fully support a large scalable social media platform.  

  * Things Learned  

    I learned that the Mongoose documentation is very well written and the tools are intuitive to use. Making the API routes without having to do much if any debugging proved how much I really did learn about using Mongoose to manage an entire database.
